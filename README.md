# Online-payment-fraud-Detection

**Overview**

This project implements a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud using Logistic Regression. The model achieves 91% accuracy on test data while handling the challenge of highly imbalanced dataset where fraudulent transactions represent a small minority of cases.

**Dataset**

The project uses a CSV file containing credit card transactions with their corresponding fraud/non-fraud labels. The dataset is characterized by a significant class imbalance, with fraudulent transactions being rare compared to legitimate ones.

**Data Characteristics:**

Transaction features
Binary classification (Fraud/Non-Fraud)
Imbalanced class distribution

**Handling Imbalanced Data**

Analysis of class distribution
Implementation of balancing techniques
Data validation

**Model Development**
